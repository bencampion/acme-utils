==========

Useful Java utility methods implemented using novel, inefficient, obfuscated and wrong headed techniques. Includes hidden gems such as:

- Sleep sort implementation that supports negative numbers and lets you trade accuracy for speed
- Negation of the `Boolean.TRUE` and `Boolean.FALSE` "constants"
- Mutation of Java's so-called "immutable" strings
- Throwing undeclared checked exceptions
- And much, much more!
